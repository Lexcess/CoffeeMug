# CoffeeMug Implementation in LISP Language

Lisp is the second-oldest (1950) high-level programming language after Fortran. Lisp was invented by **John McCarthy** in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

A Quote from [How Lisp Became God's Own Programming Language](https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html)

*"Lisp transcends the utilitarian criteria used to judge other languages, because the median programmer has never used Lisp to build anything practical and probably never will, yet the reverence for Lisp runs so deep that Lisp is often ascribed mystical properties."*

This implemntation of LISP will certainly looks cool on the mug, though it misses the ```object.[mM]essage``` syntax.
